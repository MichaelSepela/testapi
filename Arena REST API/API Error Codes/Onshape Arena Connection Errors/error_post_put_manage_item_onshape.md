# Errors When Updating and Creating Items
Item management includes Item creation and updates that apply core and custom attributes. This process starts when an Onshape part is synced with Arena. If the Onshape part is new and assigned a reserved number then a POST /items endpoint will create the item in Arena. If the Onshape part exists in Arena then a PUT /items endpoint updates the Arena item.

POST /items

PUT /items

These endpoints are used to create or update items with basic & attributes. The POST /login & POST /login/authorizeuser endpoints are a pre-requisite prior to it’s execution.    The Onshape User Arena authorize user must have a Full License, Item Read & Write and File Read & Edit Access Policy Rules in Arena. If the POST /items endpoint fails then the part should not be created. If the PUT /items endpoint fails then that specific update will not be applied. However, if the previous PUT /items were successful then those updates will be applied.
