These endpoints are used to create or update an item’s bill of materials with bom additional attributes. These endpoints require that the Authorize User must have a Full License, Item Read & Write and File Read & Edit Access Policy Rules in Arena. This endpoint will return the following error information under the following scenarios:  


| Status Code<br> | Error Code<br> | Message<br> | Explanation<br> |
|  --- |  --- |  --- |  --- | 
| 400<br> | 3230<br> |  ```Quantity ({0}) does not match number of reference designators specified for the BOM line.```  | The BOM Item Reference Designator Information Count does not match the Quantity.<br>Example: Quantity \(3\) does not match number of reference designators specified for the BOM line.<br>Dependent: This error is dependent on the Arena &gt; Workspace Settings &gt; Summary &gt; Settings - Reference Designator Checking for New Assemblies = Check.<br>\{0\} - BOM Item Quantity.<br> |
| 400<br> | 3227<br> |  ```Quantity must be positive.```  | The BOM Item Quantity is assigned a negative value when negative quantities are not allowed.<br>Example: Quantity \(-1\) does not match number of reference designators specified for the BOM line.<br>Dependent: This error is dependent on the Arena &gt; Workspace Settings &gt; Summary &gt; Settings - Negative Quantities Allowed = No<br>\{0\} - BOM Item Quantity<br> |
| 400<br> | 3235<br> |  <br>```Cannot add duplicate item "{0}"“{1}”.```  | The Item already exists on the BOM and duplicates are not allowed.<br>Example: Cannot add duplicate item \"VDXGLADW4SBJ2GY3EITQ\" \”100-0001\”.<br>Dependent: This error is dependent on the Arena &gt; Workspace Settings &gt; Summary &gt; Settings - Identical BOM Items Allowed = No<br>\{0\} - Item GUID<br>\{1\} - Item Number or Item Name.<br> |
| 400<br> | 3229<br> |  ```Reference designator "{0}" is already defined in BOM Line: {1}.```  | The Reference Designator Information is already assigned on the BOM to another BOM Item when duplicate Refdes information is not allowed.<br>Example: Reference designator \"\[R6, R7\]\" is already defined in BOM Line: N5P8D25OWK3ATC1ZJM6C.<br>Dependent: This error is dependent on the Arena &gt; Workspace Settings &gt; Summary &gt; Settings - Reference Designator Checking for New Assemblies = Check.<br>\{0\} - Duplicate Reference Designator<br>\{1\} - BOM Item Number GUID.<br> |
| 400<br> | 3232<br> |  ```The attribute "{0}" is not editable for this BOM.```  | The line number is being assigned a value when the system is setup to automatically generate line numbers.<br>The attribute \"lineNumber\" is not editable for this BOM.<br>Dependent: This error is dependent on the Arena &gt; Workspace Settings &gt; Summary &gt; Settings - Line Numbering Method for New Assemblies = Automatically Generate.<br>\{0\} - Line Number.<br> |
| 400<br> | 2014<br> |  ```Empty or blank is not a valid option for additional attribute "{0}"“{1}”.```  | The BOM Attribute being updated with an empty value.<br>Example: Empty or blank is not a valid option for additional attribute \"Q8SBG58RZN4M5O7Q9QTV\" \”OnShapeCreated\”.<br>Make sure that the BOM Attribute has a value list that contains all possible allowed values \(i.e. Yes, No\)<br>\{0\} - BOM Attribute GUID.<br>\{1\} - BOM Attribute Name.<br> |
| 400<br> | 2002<br> |  ```The specified value "{0}" is not a valid option for additional attribute "{1}".```  | The BOM Attribute being updated is being assigned an invalid value \(i.e. OnshapeCreated allows Yes or No but the system passes something different.<br>Example: The specified value \"TBD\" is not a valid option for additional attribute \"OnshapeCreated\".<br>Make sure that the BOM Attribute has a value list that contains all possible allowed values \(i.e. Yes, No\)<br>\{0\} - Assigned Value.<br>\{1\} - BOM Attribute Name.<br> |
| 400<br> | 3037<br> |  ```The item "{0}"“{1}” appears at a higher level in the fully indented BOM and cannot be added at this level.```  | The BOM Item being added already appears at a higher level in the bom structure. This will result in recursive reference. Simple example is attempting to add an Item to it’s own Bill of Materials.<br>Example: The item \"5N7QVKN6E2LTCQ8DOIV3\" \”100-0001\” appears at a higher level in the fully indented BOM and cannot be added at this level.<br>\{0\} - Item GUID.<br>\{1\} - Item Number.<br> |
| 400<br> | 3237<br> |  ```An item can only be added to the working revision BOM. Effective BOMs are locked from editing.```  | The working revision of the Item has been assigned to a Change that is submitted for approval or has been approved and is waiting to be made effective.<br>Viewing the Item in Arena you will see locks on the Item &gt; Bill of Materials section.<br>An item can only be added to the working revision BOM. Effective BOMs are locked from editing.<br> |
| 400<br> | 3233<br> |  ```Notes must be smaller than 4000.```  | BOM notes cannot exceed 4000 characters.<br> |
| 400<br> | 3606<br> |  ```Invalid reference designator: “{0}” Reference designators must be entered as a comma separated list using format [letter][number] or [letter][number]-[letter][number] for a range. Ex: R1,R2,R4-R10.```  | Reference designators can only be entered as a letter and a number pair separated by commas. A range of reference designators can be indicated by a dash.<br>\{0\} - Invalid Reference Designator Being Assigned<br> |
