These endpoints are used to create or update an item’s bill of materials with bom additional attributes. These endpoints require that the Authorize User must have a Full License, Item Read & Write and File Read & Edit Access Policy Rules in Arena. This endpoint will return the following error information under the following scenarios:  


| Status Code  | Error Code  | Message  | Explanation  |
|  --- |  --- |  --- |  --- | 
| 400  | 3230  |  ```Quantity ({0}) does not match number of reference designators specified for the BOM line.```    | The BOM Item Reference Designator Information Count does not match the Quantity. Example: Quantity \(3\) does not match number of reference designators specified for the BOM line. <br> Dependent: This error is dependent on the Arena &gt; Workspace Settings &gt;  Summary &gt; Settings - Reference Designator Checking for New Assemblies = Check. <br> \{0\} - BOM Item Quantity.<br>   |
| 400  | 3227  |  ```Quantity must be positive.```    | The BOM Item Quantity is assigned a negative value when negative quantities are not allowed.Example: Quantity \(-1\) does not match number of reference designators specified for the BOM line.<br> Dependent: This error is dependent on the Arena &gt; Workspace Settings &gt;  Summary &gt; Settings - Negative Quantities Allowed = No<br> \{0\} - BOM Item Quantity<br>   |
| 400  | 3235  | ```Cannot add duplicate item "{0}"“{1}”.```    | The Item already exists on the BOM and duplicates are not allowed.Example: Cannot add duplicate item \"VDXGLADW4SBJ2GY3EITQ\" \”100-0001\”.<br> Dependent: This error is dependent on the Arena &gt; Workspace Settings &gt;  Summary &gt; Settings - Identical BOM Items Allowed = No<br> \{0\} - Item GUID<br> \{1\} - Item Number or Item Name.<br>   |
| 400  | 3229  |  ```Reference designator "{0}" is already defined in BOM Line: {1}.```    | The Reference Designator Information is already assigned on the BOM to another BOM Item when duplicate Refdes information is not allowed.Example: Reference designator \"\[R6, R7\]\" is already defined in BOM Line: N5P8D25OWK3ATC1ZJM6C.<br> Dependent: This error is dependent on the Arena &gt; Workspace Settings &gt;  Summary &gt; Settings - Reference Designator Checking for New Assemblies = Check. <br> \{0\} - Duplicate Reference Designator <br> \{1\} - BOM Item Number GUID.<br>   |
| 400  | 3232  |  ```The attribute "{0}" is not editable for this BOM.```    | The line number is being assigned a value when the system is setup to automatically generate line numbers.The attribute \"lineNumber\" is not editable for this BOM.<br> Dependent: This error is dependent on the Arena &gt; Workspace Settings &gt;  Summary &gt; Settings - Line Numbering Method for New Assemblies = Automatically Generate.<br> \{0\} - Line Number.<br>   |
| 400  | 2014  |  ```Empty or blank is not a valid option for additional attribute "{0}"“{1}”.```    | The BOM Attribute being updated with an empty value.Example: Empty or blank is not a valid option for additional attribute \"Q8SBG58RZN4M5O7Q9QTV\" \”OnShapeCreated\”.<br> Make sure that the BOM Attribute has a value list that contains all possible allowed values \(i.e. Yes, No\)<br> \{0\} - BOM Attribute GUID.<br> \{1\} - BOM Attribute Name.<br>   |
| 400  | 2002  |  ```The specified value "{0}" is not a valid option for additional attribute "{1}".```    | The BOM Attribute being updated is being assigned an invalid value \(i.e. OnshapeCreated allows Yes or No but the system passes something different.Example: The specified value \"TBD\" is not a valid option for additional attribute \"OnshapeCreated\".<br> Make sure that the BOM Attribute has a value list that contains all possible allowed values \(i.e. Yes, No\)<br> \{0\} - Assigned Value.<br> \{1\} - BOM Attribute Name.<br>   |
| 400  | 3037  |  ```The item "{0}"“{1}” appears at a higher level in the fully indented BOM and cannot be added at this level.```    | The BOM Item being added already appears at a higher level in the bom structure. This will result in recursive reference. Simple example is attempting to add an Item to it’s own Bill of Materials.Example: The item \"5N7QVKN6E2LTCQ8DOIV3\" \”100-0001\” appears at a higher level in the fully indented BOM and cannot be added at this level.<br> \{0\} - Item GUID.<br> \{1\} - Item Number.<br>   |
| 400  | 3237  |  ```An item can only be added to the working revision BOM. Effective BOMs are locked from editing.```    | The working revision of the Item has been assigned to a Change that is submitted for approval or has been approved and is waiting to be made effective.Viewing the Item in Arena you will see locks on the Item &gt; Bill of Materials section. <br> An item can only be added to the working revision BOM. Effective BOMs are locked from editing.<br>   |
| 400  | 3233  |  ```Notes must be smaller than 4000.```    | BOM notes cannot exceed 4000 characters.  |
| 400  | 3606  |  ```Invalid reference designator: “{0}” Reference designators must be entered as a comma separated list using format [letter][number] or [letter][number]-[letter][number] for a range. Ex: R1,R2,R4-R10.```    | Reference designators can only be entered as a letter and a number pair separated by commas. A range of reference designators can be indicated by a dash.\{0\} - Invalid Reference Designator Being Assigned<br>   |
