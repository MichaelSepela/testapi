# PUT Import Commit


/imports/&lt;GUID&gt;/runs/&lt;GUID&gt;

When performing a POST import run endpoint, users can set the commit value to false. The import then can use information within the response and GET import run error content or GET import run results content to find any errors within an import run. This allows users to double check for any import errors without commiting it to the workspace.

Once the user has completed troubleshooting the errors, they can then use this PUT Import commit endpoint to commit the import to the workspace.

Please note that this endpoint is uni\-directional. Once the import commit has been set to true, it cannot be returned to a value of false.
