# PUT BOM Substitute Create


/items/&lt;GUID&gt;/bom/&lt;GUID&gt;/substitutes/&lt;GUID&gt;

Edits an existing  BOM Substitute for an item with a given GUID. Only the working reivision of the parent Item can be modified with BOM Substitutes. Items must be released to be specified as a subtitute. BOM Substitutes can be superseded revisions of the child Item. Existing BOM Substitutes can not be added again to the same BOM Line.

Rank is a positive integeter between one and the total number of substitutes. If the user specifies a rank that already exists, the new BOM Substitute will be assigned that rank and the ranks of all other substitutes that have a higher rank value \(including the BOM Substitute that previously had the specified rank value\) will be incremented by one. If rank is not specified in the POST, it is set to the last rank.
